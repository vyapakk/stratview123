/**
 * BACKEND INTEGRATION POINT: Dataset Categories & Purchase Status
 * 
 * Replace this static array with an API call. The API should return the same
 * structure but with `purchased` resolved per authenticated user at the DASHBOARD level.
 * 
 * Expected API: GET /api/datasets?user_id={userId}
 * Expected Response: Same structure as below, with `purchased: true/false` per dashboard
 * 
 * The `purchased` field on each dashboard controls:
 * - Dataset listing (DatasetList.tsx): Shows lock if NO dashboards are purchased
 * - Subscriptions (SubscriptionsSection.tsx): Shows dataset if ANY dashboard is purchased
 * - Detail page (DatasetDetail.tsx): Per-dashboard lock icon and access request
 * 
 * DASHBOARD AUTO-DISCOVERY:
 * Real dashboards are auto-registered from each dashboard's config.ts `catalog` field.
 * Only placeholder/future dashboards need to be listed here manually.
